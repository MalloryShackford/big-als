      <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At Big Al’s Pizza, we’re more than just a pizza shop—we’re a family. Founded by husband-and-wife  duo, we set out to create a cozy neighborhood spot where great food and good company come together.

        Our passion for pizza goes beyond just the ingredients—it’s about the experience. From our carefully crafted dough to our signature sauces, every pizza is made with love and a commitment to quality. We believe in bringing people together, whether it's for a quick bite, a family dinner, or a celebration with friends.

        As a small, family-owned business, we take pride in serving our community with delicious, handcrafted pizzas. Our goal is to brighten your day with every slice, and to make Big Al’s Pizza a place where everyone feels at home.

        We can’t wait to welcome you in and share our love of pizza with you!
